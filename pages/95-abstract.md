### Overview

Source: [Science Buddies](http://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/project_abstract.shtml)

An abstract is an abbreviated version of your science fair project final report. For most science fairs it is limited to a maximum of 250 words (check the rules for your competition). The science fair project abstract appears at the beginning of the report as well as on your display board.

Almost all scientists and engineers agree that an abstract should have the following five pieces:

1. Introduction - This is where you describe the purpose for doing your science fair project or invention. 
2. Problem Statement - Identify the problem you solved or the hypothesis you investigated.
3. Procedures - What was your approach for investigating the problem? 
4. Results - What answer did you obtain? Be specific and use numbers to describe your results.
5. Conclusions - State what your science fair project or invention contributes to the area you worked in. Did you meet your objectives?

### Things to Avoid

* Avoid jargon or any technical terms that most readers won't understand.
* Avoid abbreviations or acronyms that are not commonly understood unless you describe what they mean.
* Abstracts do not have a bibliography or citations.
* Abstracts do not contain tables or graphs.
* For most science fairs, the abstract must focus on the previous 12 months' research (or less), and give only minimal reference to any earlier work.
* If you are working with a scientist or mentor, your abstract should only include procedures done by you, and you should not put acknowledgements to anyone in your abstract.
